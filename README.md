## Documentation
- This plugin allows you to protect your world from grief, pvp, commands, items, and decaying blocks.
- For example, you can use `/wp build world true` to prevent other players from destroying your world named `world`.
- You can also use /wp pvp world false to disable pvp in a world.
- If you want to keep a certain inventory after you die then you can run this command, editing 'NAME' to your world name `/wp keepinv NAME true`. This world will now keep your inventory after you die.
- If you do not know the `TypeId` of a block then don't worry, just hold the item in your hand and run this command, editing 'NAME' to your world name `/wp banitem NAME`
